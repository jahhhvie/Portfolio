            Why a League of Legends app?
        </h1>
            <p>
                I’ve been playing League of Legends for some time now and though there are various products out there now I feel like there was a call for something that was simple and direct.I wanted something to give me all the notes and news updates as well as see who’s online without me having to actually log in to the game.

            My Design Process
        </h1>
            <p>
                My main focus when coming into this project was to make it feel as native to the actual game client as possible. Why take the time to sit down at a computer and load up the game when you can just grab your phone and check in? I'm the type of person who doesn't like to play alone so I think it's pretty handy to have the option to check and see if you even have any friends on without ever having to start up your computer.

            <p>Home Page: For this page I wanted it to resemble the launch portal of the game. You get all the latest news and updates for the week. Just as with the launch portal as well, when you activate one of the links it will take you the more in depth article on the League of Legends website.</p>
            <p>Summoner Page: I wanted the summoner page to be as simple as possible. You can come to it, check your ranked stats for the season, see your summoner icon and check your match history. The match history will display what game mode you played, whether you won or lost, how long the game was and then the basic in game logistics. </p>
            <p>Chat Page: League of Legends has a very good built in chat system that display a miriadeof information for the summoners that are in your friends list. At the top we have the tool to search either through your friends list or for a summoner that you’re trying to find. Each summoner has a status bubble to reflect their current status. For the summoners that are in game, their in game time will be displayed along with the in game message.
